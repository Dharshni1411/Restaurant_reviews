# Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains code to analyze the sentiment of restaurant reviews using machine learning models.

## What's in this Repository?

### Dataset
- The dataset (`Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`) contains 1000 restaurant reviews, each labeled as "Liked" or "Not Liked".

### Jupyter Notebook

- It achieves an accuracy of around 76.5% on the test set.
- Detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are provided.

### Random Forest Classifier
- Another model explored is the Random Forest Classifier.
- It achieves an accuracy of approximately 71.5% on the test set.
- Similar to the Naive Bayes model, it includes detailed evaluation metrics.
